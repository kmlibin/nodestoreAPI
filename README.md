## node store api

This project focuses on filtering, sorting, and using query params to interact with an api. The api is build with Node, Express, Mongoose, and uses Mongo Atlas. It is essentially a practice project to get familiar with how to use Mongoose methods to find data on MongoDB (and yes, like many other practice projects, I haven't removed my notes from the code).

The weirdest one for me was dealing with numbers and using JS methods to replace standard mathematical operators with operators that Mongoose understands. I had to look over that one a couple of times and take plenty of notes. Setting up pagination was new, and I enjoyed that.
